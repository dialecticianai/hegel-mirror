# Mirror

**Ephemeral Markdown review UI for Dialectic-Driven Development**

[![Built with DDD](https://img.shields.io/badge/built_with-DDD-blue)](https://github.com/dialecticianai/ddd-book/)

## What is Mirror?

Mirror is a zero-friction GUI for reviewing Markdown documents in human-AI collaborative development workflows. Designed for programmatic invocation by agents and natural use by humans.

**Core concept:** Launch → review → comment → exit. No persistent state, no configuration, just pure review flow.

**Part of the Hegel ecosystem:** Mirror is the review UI companion to [Hegel CLI](https://github.com/dialecticianai/hegel-cli), providing human-in-the-loop approval for AI-generated artifacts in Dialectic-Driven Development workflows.

## Features

### Markdown Rendering
- Full Markdown support: text, headers, lists, blockquotes
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks (via `syntect`)
- Tables with proper grid layout
- Images (local file paths)
- Lazy rendering with viewport culling (60fps on 11K+ line documents)

### Review Workflow
- **Line-precise text selection** - Click and drag to select text
- **Floating comment UI** - Smart positioning with scroll indicators
- **Multi-file tabs** - Review multiple documents simultaneously
- **Independent comment queues** - Each file has its own review state
- **Dual review modes**:
  - **Immediate mode** (default) - Each comment saves instantly
  - **Batched mode** - Queue comments, submit atomically

### Review Persistence
- JSONL format (`.ddd/<filename>.review.N`)
- Monotonic sequence numbers (never overwrites previous reviews)
- Full metadata: timestamp, session ID, file, selection range, text snippet
- Separate review files per document

### Integration
- CLI: `--out-dir`, `--json`, `--headless`
- Environment: `HEGEL_SESSION_ID` passthrough
- Exit codes: 0 (success), 1 (error), 2 (cancelled)

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for future enhancements.

## Philosophy

Mirror embodies three principles:

1. **Ephemerality as feature** - No persistent state. Launch → review → exit.
2. **Agent-first, human-compatible** - Designed for `hegel reflect` invocation, delightful for humans.
3. **Zero friction** - Single binary, no install, no config. Just works.

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for full philosophy.
