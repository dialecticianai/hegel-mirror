# Assessment 0 — Markdown Features Research

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Phase**: Research mode - Mirror rendering engine study
**Status**: Complete

---

## What We Studied

**Sources analyzed**:
- `src/parsing/` - parser.rs, chunks.rs, html.rs, position.rs (4 files)
- `src/rendering/` - chunk_renderer.rs, text_builder.rs, inline_batcher.rs, code.rs, table.rs, image.rs (6+ files)
- `src/models/` - chunk.rs (TextChunk structure)
- Existing tests: test_bold.md, test_centered_image.md, tests/fixtures/*.md

**Coverage**: All Priority 0-2 items from RESEARCH_PLAN.md
- ✅ Parsing layer analysis
- ✅ Rendering layer analysis
- ✅ Existing test analysis

## Key Insights

### 1. Comprehensive but Incomplete Feature Support

**Insight**: Mirror has solid coverage of core markdown but gaps in common features

**Supported well**:
- Text formatting (bold, italic, combined)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables with alignment
- Images with HTML-enhanced positioning
- Emoji via Twemoji

**Missing tests** (features work but untested):
- Inline code (backticks)
- Headings (H1-H6 systematic test)
- Standard markdown images
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Blockquotes

**Not implemented**:
- Horizontal rules
- Clickable links (only text displayed)
- Blockquote styling
- Task lists

**Implication**: Need systematic test fixtures for existing features before adding new ones

### 2. Inline Text Batching is Critical

**Insight**: The inline_batcher.rs system is what makes bold/italic flow naturally

**Pattern**:
- Consecutive inline chunks → horizontal_wrapped layout
- List items explicitly excluded (bullet detection prevents batching)
- Enables bold/italic text to flow mid-sentence without line breaks

**Gotcha discovered**: Lists required special handling to prevent wrapping

**Implication**: Any new inline formatting must consider batching behavior

### 3. Position Tracking Powers Review Comments

**Insight**: Every chunk has precise byte ranges and line/col positions

**Architecture**:
- LineOffsets struct: O(log n) byte → line/col conversion
- Binary search on precomputed offset table
- Enables review comments to reference exact selections

**Implication**: Test fixtures should include multi-line selections to validate position tracking

### 4. Font System Complexity

**Insight**: Bold/italic rendering requires actual font files, not just styling

**Implementation**:
- 4 font families embedded: Regular, Bold, Italic, BoldItalic
- Adds ~800KB to binary
- Ensures consistent cross-platform rendering

**Trade-off**: Binary size vs typography control (chose control)

**Implication**: Bold/italic tests are actually testing font loading and rendering, not just markdown parsing

### 5. Table Emoji Gotcha

**Insight**: Emoji in tables use different rendering path than body text

**Why**: egui::Grid layout incompatible with EmojiLabel's layout behavior

**Workaround**: Tables use regular Label (loses colored emoji)

**Implication**: Test fixtures should include emoji in tables to document this limitation

## Questions Answered

**Q: What markdown features does Mirror support?**
A: Comprehensive catalog documented in learnings/markdown_features.md

**Q: What's missing from test coverage?**
A: 6 critical gaps identified (inline code, headings, standard images, lists, blockquotes, links)

**Q: How does bold/italic text flow inline?**
A: inline_batcher.rs groups consecutive text chunks into horizontal_wrapped layout

**Q: Why do we need actual Bold/Italic fonts?**
A: egui font system requires separate font files for each style variant

## Questions Raised (Discovery Phase)

**Systematic test creation**:
- [ ] How should we organize test fixtures? (By feature? By category?)
- [ ] Should each feature have its own file or combine related features?
- [ ] What naming convention? (test_inline_code.md? fixtures/inline_code.md?)

**Edge case validation**:
- [ ] Does nested formatting work in all combinations? (`**bold *italic* bold**`)
- [ ] What happens with very long headings? (Wrapping behavior?)
- [ ] Do tables handle empty cells correctly?
- [ ] How do images fail gracefully when file missing?

**Implementation gaps**:
- [ ] Should we add horizontal rule support? (Low complexity, high visibility)
- [ ] Should blockquotes get visual styling? (Indentation, border)
- [ ] Are clickable links worth implementing? (External dependency on URL handling)

## Decisions Made

**Decision 1: Defer implementation, focus on testing**
- Rationale: Many features already work but lack systematic tests
- Action: Create comprehensive test fixtures for existing features first
- Validate: Then consider adding horizontal rules, blockquote styling, etc.

**Decision 2: Hierarchical test organization**
- Rationale: tests/fixtures/ already exists, use it
- Structure:
  - tests/fixtures/inline_formatting.md (bold, italic, code)
  - tests/fixtures/headings.md (H1-H6)
  - tests/fixtures/lists.md (ordered, unordered)
  - tests/fixtures/images.md (standard + HTML variants)
  - tests/fixtures/blockquotes.md
  - tests/fixtures/edge_cases.md (nested formatting, unusual combinations)
- Benefit: Clean separation, easy to run individually with mirror

**Decision 3: Document limitations explicitly**
- Rationale: Some features (like table emoji) have known constraints
- Action: Test fixtures should include these cases with comments
- Benefit: Users understand rendering behavior, not surprised by limitations

## What's Next

**Ready to transition to Discovery mode**

**Why**: Research complete, questions are practical (what works? what breaks? edge cases?)

**Discovery goals**:
1. Create systematic test fixtures following decision 2 structure
2. Run mirror on each fixture, validate rendering
3. Document any unexpected behavior
4. Capture edge cases for future reference

**SPEC.md topics for Discovery**:
- Test fixture organization (directory structure, naming)
- Feature coverage matrix (what to include in each file)
- Edge case catalog (unusual combinations to test)
- Documentation approach (comments in fixtures vs separate docs)

**Success criteria**:
- [ ] Test fixture for every supported feature
- [ ] Edge cases documented and tested
- [ ] Limitations explicitly noted in test files
- [ ] README.md updated with test fixture usage

## Meta-Reflection

**What worked well**:
- Prior CODE_MAP creation meant I already understood the codebase deeply
- Systematic priority ordering (parsing → rendering → tests) created natural flow
- Feature catalog format (feature → parsing → rendering → coverage) is reusable

**What was challenging**:
- Distinguishing "feature exists but untested" from "feature not implemented"
- Cataloging edge cases without actually testing them (theory vs practice gap)

**Lessons for next research**:
- Start with existing documentation (CODE_MAPs, ARCHITECTURE.md) - saves time
- Catalog systematically (don't jump around features randomly)
- Use checkboxes for coverage status (visual at-a-glance gaps)
