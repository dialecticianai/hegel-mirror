# ROADMAP.md

**Hegel Mirror**: Ephemeral Markdown review UI for Dialectic-Driven Development.

---

## Vision

Mirror is the human-in-the-loop approval interface for DDD workflows. It bridges the gap between AI-generated artifacts and human oversight, providing a zero-friction review experience that agents can invoke programmatically and humans can use naturally.

**Core purpose**: Markdown preview and review. Launch, read, comment, submit. That's it.

---

## Current Status

**Phase 1: MVP** - Core rendering and interaction complete ‚úÖ

We've built a fully functional Markdown viewer with:
- Complete Markdown rendering (text, code blocks with syntax highlighting, tables, images)
- Line-precise text selection with visual highlighting
- Floating comment UI with smart positioning
- Lazy rendering with viewport culling (60fps on 11K+ line documents)
- Theme system for typography and layout
- ~1,500 lines of Rust across 24 modules

**Next:** Review file persistence (write comments to `.ddd/<filename>.review.N`)

---

## Guiding Principles

1. **Ephemerality as feature**: No persistent state. Launch ‚Üí review ‚Üí exit. Like `$EDITOR` for git commits.
2. **Agent-first, human-compatible**: Designed for programmatic invocation, delightful for humans.
3. **Zero friction**: Single binary, no install, no config. Just works.
4. **Append-only history**: Never overwrite reviews. Monotonic sequence provides full audit trail.
5. **Local-first**: No network, no cloud, no dependencies. Fully offline.
6. **Cross-platform**: macOS, Linux, Windows. Native performance everywhere.

## Phase 1: MVP - Markdown Review

### 1.1 Core UI (Milestone M1: Single-file review) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Goal:** Launch mirror with single Markdown file, display rendered content, submit review to `.ddd/<filename>.review.1`.

**Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ `egui` window with full Markdown rendering
  - Text paragraphs with wrapping
  - Code blocks with syntax highlighting (via `syntect`)
  - Tables with proper grid layout
  - Images (local file paths)
  - Headers, lists, blockquotes
- ‚úÖ Line-precise text selection with mouse drag
  - Visual highlight bars for selected lines
  - Multi-chunk selection support
  - Hover indicators and click-to-clear
- ‚úÖ Floating comment UI in right margin
  - Aligned with selection
  - Scroll indicators when off-screen
  - Text input field
- ‚úÖ Lazy rendering with cached heights
  - Viewport culling for performance
  - Smooth 60fps scrolling on 11K+ line documents
- ‚úÖ Theme system
  - Typography configuration (fonts, sizes, spacing)
  - Layout controls (margins, max width)
  - Swappable theme definitions
- ‚úÖ CLI argument parsing (`--out-dir`, `--json`, `--headless`)

**Architecture:**
- `src/main.rs` - CLI entry point with `clap`
- `src/app.rs` - Main application struct and update loop
- `src/parsing/` - Markdown parsing into chunks
- `src/rendering/` - Rendering system (text, code, tables, images, comments)
- `src/models/` - Data structures (Chunk, Selection, Comment, LayoutMap)
- `src/syntax/` - Syntax highlighting via `syntect`
- `src/theme/` - Theme system

**Not yet implemented:**
- ‚ùå Review file persistence (`.ddd/<filename>.review.N`)
- ‚ùå Auto-exit on submit
- ‚ùå "Submit Review" button (UI scaffolding exists but no action)

**Testing:**
- Manual testing with various Markdown files
- Performance tested with 11K+ line documents

---

### 1.2 Review persistence (Milestone M2) üöß **IN PROGRESS**

**Goal:** Write comments to `.ddd/<filename>.review.N` files with monotonic sequence numbers.

**Features:**
- "Submit Review" button writes comments to disk
- JSONL format: one comment per line
- Monotonic sequence: `.review.1`, `.review.2`, etc.
- Include metadata: timestamp, session ID (from env), file path, selection range
- Auto-exit on submit (or ask user)

**Implementation:**
- `src/storage.rs` - JSONL writing, monotonic sequence logic
- Hook up "Submit Review" button in `src/rendering/comments.rs`
- Add exit logic after successful write

**Testing:**
- Integration test: Verify JSONL format
- Test monotonic sequence (multiple reviews of same file)
- Test session ID passthrough from environment

**Acceptance:**
```bash
export HEGEL_SESSION_ID="abc123"
mirror test.md --out-dir /tmp/reviews
# User selects text, adds comment, clicks submit
# Verify /tmp/reviews/test.review.1 exists and contains valid JSONL with session_id
```

---

### 1.3 Multi-file tabs (Milestone M3)

**Goal:** Support multiple Markdown files as tabs, independent comment queues per file.

**Features:**
- Tab bar at top of window
- Click tab to switch active document
- Each tab shows comment count: `SPEC.md (3)`
- Submit writes separate `.review.N` file per document

**Implementation:**
- `src/ui/tabs.rs` - Tab bar widget, tab switching logic
- Refactor `app.rs` to hold `Vec<Document>` with active index
- Each `Document` has independent comment queue and selection state

**Testing:**
- Integration test: `mirror file1.md file2.md`
- Verify separate `.review.N` files created

**Acceptance:**
```bash
mirror SPEC.md PLAN.md
# User reviews both, adds comments to each
# Submit ‚Üí verify .ddd/SPEC.review.1 and .ddd/PLAN.review.1
```

---

### 1.4 Immediate vs batched review (Milestone M4)

**Goal:** Two modes - immediate commenting (default) and batched review.

**Features:**
- Default: Every comment saves immediately (append to `.review.N`)
- "Start Review" button: Enter batch mode
  - Comments queued in memory only
  - "Submit Review" button appears
  - Click submit ‚Üí atomic write all comments ‚Üí exit
- User can toggle between modes mid-session

**Implementation:**
- `src/review_mode.rs` - Enum: Immediate vs Batched
- Refactor comment handling to check mode before writing
- Add "Start Review" / "Submit Review" buttons conditionally

**Testing:**
- Test immediate: Verify `.review.N` grows on each comment
- Test batched: Verify `.review.N` empty until submit

**Acceptance:**
```bash
mirror SPEC.md
# Immediate: Each comment ‚Üí immediate write
# Batched: "Start Review" ‚Üí queue comments ‚Üí "Submit" ‚Üí atomic write
```

---

### 1.6 Keyboard shortcuts (Milestone M6)

**Goal:** Power-user navigation.

**Features:**
- Keyboard shortcuts:
  - `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` - Next/previous tab (when multi-file tabs implemented)
  - `Ctrl+Enter` - Submit review
  - `Escape` - Cancel/clear selection
  - `Ctrl+Q` - Quit without submitting (batch mode)

**Implementation:**
- `src/keyboard.rs` - Keyboard event handling
- Hook into egui input handling in `app.rs`

**Testing:**
